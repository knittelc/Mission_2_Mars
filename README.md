# Mission to Mars
## Overview
I was hired to automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars.  I scraped articles with their titles, images of Mars and its hemispheres, and a Mars Facts data table.  The competed work scrapes for the newest featured articles, pictures and tables.  Web scraping is a method used by organizations worldwide to extract online data for analysis.  It also helps to automate tedious tasks for smaller projects.  The outcome is to use these methods and start an HTML portfolio so future companies can see my capabilities.
